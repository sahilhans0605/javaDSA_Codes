//        A BST is a binary tree where each element in the left subtree is smaller and each element in right subtree is greater than the curr/root element/node
//        This is true for each node
//        Inorder traversal of a Binary search tree is a sorted array
//        In bst every operation is done in O(logn)...where as in other data structures it takes O(1)/O(n)...
//        TreeSet contains sorted element....so treeSet uses bst internally...
//        bst use case in real world...sorting
//        BST makes searching efficient....than binary tree...O(n)binary tree ----to----O(logn)...binary search tree
//        Dividing problems into subproblems i.e making recursive call on subtree
