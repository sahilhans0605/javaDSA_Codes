//        it is also a stable sorting algorithm
//        d = number of digits in a number that we are taking for sorting example d value is 4 for 2022
//        d value is 2 for 23
//        and for loop will iterate for d number of times
//        Advantage and disadvantage of radix sort
//        1 it is stable because it maintains the existing order of equal keys
//        2.it is good on small keys(4-5 digits)


//DISADVANTAGE---> It is not efficient on very long keys because total time is proportional to key length and total number of items to sort
