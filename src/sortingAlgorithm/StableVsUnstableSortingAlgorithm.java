//Stable and Unstable sort
//STABLE------------->
//if there are duplicate numbers and the number 9 comes after first 9 then second 9 should come after first nine
//farak nhi padhta dono 9 h par ye decimal ka case h isliye farak nhi padhta
//but agr students ko sort krna ho toj 2-3 name same ho skte h..par agr unke marks diff ho toh bhi same hi order mein rhe ye nhi ki aage peeche krdiya
//teeno sahil sahilnumber1 fir sahilnumber2firsahilnumber3 hi rhna chahiye


//EASY EXAMPLE
//If price of two things are same and one is new and another is old so stable soting algorithm will always put newest element on top
//while unstable sorting algorithm can will not check new or old it can put anyway according to price

//BUBBLE AND INSERTION ARE STABLE WHEREAS SELECTION IS UNSTABLE SORTING ALGORITHM
