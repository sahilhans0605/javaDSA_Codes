//        whenever a cycle is made in a graph topological sort is not possible
//        Hence topological sorting is only for directed acyclic graph(DAG)
//        IN DAG at least one vertex with in degree = 0 and at least one vertex with out degree = 0
//        Below written both conditions should be met
//        to start the process at least one vertex with indegree = 0
//        to end the process....at least one process with out degree = 0
