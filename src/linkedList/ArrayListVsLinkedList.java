//        Array List
//   INSERT--->     if we want to insert an element in an array list...it will take O(n) time...because we need to shift every element of arraylist...
//   SEARCH--->     for searching we can directly go to index O(1) time
//        Arrays in contiguous allocation
//        Memory is allocated at compile time
//        Use less memory
//        Insertion and deletion operations take time because we need to move every element to another index
//
//        LINKED LIST
//   INSERT--->     only attach pointers..means only 2-3 operations which means constant time complexity O(1)
//   SEARCH--->     O(n)...no indexing...means traverse all elements
//   DELETION---> //element can't be empty ... we delete the nodes...deletion also takes O(N)
//        Linked list not in contiguous location
////        Memory is allocated at run time
//        Use more memory...because it has both data and nodes
//        Insertion and deletion operations are faster...just need to connect link
//

//
//        add/delete-->linked list
//        search--->array list

//        HEAD --->First node of linked list
//        TAIL ---> last node

//       DOUBLE ENDED LINKED LIST--->prev pointer as well as next pointer...
//        CIRCULAR LINKED LIST--->Last node connects to first node

//        So at end they donot tell which data structure to use...example if we want to insert again and again we use linked list for searching we use array list
