public class HeapsBasics {
//    heap is used to extract min/max element from a data structure
//    Complete binary tree--->
//    Every node except theleaf node should have 2 child nodes
//    if it has one child it should have from left to right...no space should be left empty
//    The level order traversal of a complete binary tree should not have null nodes in between
//    Heaps are represented in form of arrays
//    In heaps it's children are either both smaller or both larger
//    BOTH SMALLER(MAX HEAP)...of every parent node
//    BOTH LARGER(MIN HEAP)...of every parent node

//                      CONCLUSION
//    A heap is a complete binary tree
//    It should follow min heap or max heap property
//    priority queue also works on basis of heaps
